# MySimpleAnimeList
A simple application to keep track of all your anime.  
  
With simple, I really mean simple. No API involved. You add new entries.
I used MAL before, but I like a list to be simple and adding a new entry must be easy and quick.
Since MAL felt overwhelming, I started using Excell and using Visual Basic to order my list alphabatical.
But why using Excell when you can make your own application.
